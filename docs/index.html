        <h3>DDA Algorithm</h3>
        <p> Experience unparalleled precision in your 3D world with our DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm. Every ray cast from the player’s perspective calculates exact collisions with walls, jumping from grid line to grid line instead of checking every point along the path. This ensures ultra-accurate rendering, prevents visual glitches, and makes your navigation smooth and realistic. Explore the map with confidence, knowing that every wall and corner appears exactly where it should.</p>

Running at a consistent 60 frames per second, the game delivers fluid movement and responsive controls, giving you a seamless 3D experience. No lag, no stuttering—just pure, smooth exploration. Whether you’re sneaking through corridors or surveying the environment, every motion feels natural and every action reacts instantly.</p>

        <h3>Textured Walls</h3>
        <p>Step into a world where walls are more than just barriers—they’re textured canvases that bring depth and realism to the environment. Each wall features subtle textures and shading, creating a sense of height and dimension, while different colors and lighting cues help you navigate effortlessly. With this attention to visual detail, the game transforms a simple 2D map into a rich, immersive 3D experience that’s both visually engaging and easy to read.</p>
